Just a quick note on the upcoming lecture I create a numpy array that goes from 0 to 10, and I accidentally use the word "index" when I should have said "position".

I misspoke at two timestamps in the video- at 2:51 I say "5" is at index 6, while it's actually at index 5. What I meant to say is it is the 6th element in the array, but it is located at index 5 (just like a normal Python list, indexing starts at zero in Numpy arrays). Therefore, the arr[5:] notation actually grabs everything starting with the index 5, not everything beyond index 5. I then repeat the same thing at 3:21 by saying index 5 is at 4, what I should have said was the element 4 is the 5th element in the array, but it is still at index 4. 

you should be able to watch the video lecture and clearly see how to index and slice arrays, it works exactly like a normal Python list.
