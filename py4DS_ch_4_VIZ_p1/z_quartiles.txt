What are quartiles?
    Quartiles are a set of 'descriptive statistics'. 
    They summarize the "central tendency" and 'variability of a dataset' or DISTRIBUTION.

    Quartiles are a type of percentile. 
        A 'percentile' is a value with a 'certain percentage of the data' falling below it. 
        In general terms, "k%" of the data falls below the 'k-th percentile'.



1st, 2nd, 3rd quartiles:
    The first quartile (Q1, or the Lowest quartile) 
        is the 25th percentile, meaning that 25% of the data falls below the first quartile.

    The second quartile or MEDIAN (Q2, or the Median) 
        is the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of the data falls below the second quartile.

    The third quartile (Q3, or the Upper quartile) 
        is the 75th percentile, meaning that 75% of the data falls below the third quartile.


Notes:
    By splitting the data at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, the quartiles 'divide' the data into "four equal parts".

    In a sample or dataset, the quartiles divide the data into "four groups" with "Equal Numbers of Observations".

    probability distribution:
        In a probability distribution, the 'quartiles' divide the distributionâ€™s range into four "Intervals with Equal Probability".
