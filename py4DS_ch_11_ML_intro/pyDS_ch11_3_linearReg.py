    Project 1:
        Now we'll use scikit-learn in Python to create a linear regression model.

        After that, we'll work on your own portfolio project exercise, and once completed, the solutions will be reviewed and discussed.

Linear Regression with Python: Practical Implementation

-------------------------------------

# NXT >> add codes from ipynb here


---- Check Point 3 : clarify

 
Ok like I mentioned you can go ahead and explore the Boston data set that I mentioned earlier and that's
linked in your note book.
If you want to redo this analysis on a real dataset.
But coming up next is going to be your exercise for your portfolio project.
Or we're going to give you some e-commerce data and you'll have to create a linear regression model
by following the directions in the exercise and then afterwards we'll go over the solutions.
I hope you enjoy your first foray into machine learning.
Later on we'll delve into real data sets from Kaggle dot com and perform machine learning projects that
are even more in-depth.
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
