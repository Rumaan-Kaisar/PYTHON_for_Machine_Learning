""" 

Matplotlib is the main Python library for data visualization, created by "John Hunter" 
    to replicate MatLab's plotting features in Python.

If you're familiar with MatLab, Matplotlib will feel natural.

It's a powerful 2D and 3D graphics library for scientific figures.


Pros of Matplotlib:
    - Easy to start with for simple plots
    - Supports custom labels and text
    - Full control over every element in a figure
    - High-quality output in many formats
    - Highly customizable

Matplotlib lets you create reproducible figures programmatically. 
You can explore more on the official Matplotlib website: http://matplotlib.org/.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# shows plots directly in Jupyter notebooks.
# If you're using another editor, add plt.show() at the end of your plotting commands 
#   to display the figure in a separate window
%matplotlib inline
