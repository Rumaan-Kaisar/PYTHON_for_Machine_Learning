# Choropleth Maps:
    # A Choropleth map uses colors to represent data across geographic regions.  

# Challenges in Geographical Plotting:  
    # Data often comes in varying formats (e.g., GeoJSON, Shapefiles).  
    # Requires specialized libraries for specific datasets.  

# Why Plotly?  
    # Built-in interactive features for zooming, hovering, and customization.  
    # Matplotlib's "Basemap" is deprecated (use "Cartopy" instead), but Plotly is simpler for web-ready maps.  



# Let's create a Choropleth map using Plotly!  
# It allows us to plot information on either a global or nationwide scale.  
# Choropleth maps can be challenging at first due to Plotly's syntax,  
    # so we'll use this notebook for reference.
    # also ther's a "cheat sheet" pdf for plotly:
        # https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/python_cheat_sheet.pdf

# We'll focus on:  
    # Nationwide scale plots  
    # Real-world data with larger nationwide plots  
    # World-scale plots

""" 
        Now, we need to begin building our data dictionary. 
        The easiest way to do this is by using the dict() function with the following general structure:  

        type = 'choropleth'
        locations = List of states  
        locationmode = 'USA-states'
        colorscale = Choose a predefined or custom scale  
        text = List or array of text to display per point  
        z = Array of values for the z-axis (determining state color)
        colorbar = {'title': 'Colorbar Title'}
"""
# Choosing a Colorscale
# You can select from predefined color scales, such as:  
    # 'pairs'
    # 'Greys'
    # 'Greens'
    # 'Bluered'
    # 'Hot'
    # 'Picnic'
    # 'Portland'
    # 'Jet'
    # 'RdBu'
    # 'Blackbody'
    # 'Earth'
    # 'Electric'
    # 'YIOrRd'
    # 'YIGnBu'

# or create a custom colorscale (https://plot.ly/python/heatmap-and-contour-colorscales/)
# Here we make it like below:

# first we build our data-dictionary
# We'll use the dict() method to create a dictionary.
    # to cast a list to the dictionary

data = dict(type = 'choropleth',
            locations = ['AZ', 'CA', 'NY'],
            locationmode = 'USA-states',
            colorscale = 'Portland',
            text = ['text 1', 'text 2', 'text 3'],
            z = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
            colorbar = {'title':'colorbar title goes here'}
        )

# Define key elements:

    # "type": 
        # Set as 'choropleth'
        # In our "data" object, 'type' specifies what kind of geographical plot we're doing.  
    
    # "locations": 
        # List of state abbreviations (e.g., ['AZ', 'CA', 'NY']).
    
    # "locationmode": 
        # Set to 'USA-states'. It'll let plotly know that we're doing this in US-level
        # Since we're working with the USA, we specify 'USA-states'. This applies at the state level.  
        # theres' also different location modes, more in "documentation"
        # For more detail (e.g., county level), refer to the documentation.

    # "text": 
        # List of hover text values, i.e. each of the locations.
        # a list of text labels for each location in the 'locations' list, passed in the same indexed sequence.
    
    # "z": 
        # actual values shown in to the coloscale.
        # Values representing the color intensity for each location. 
        # Later, we'll see how to color different states by intensity.

    # "colorscale": 
        # Defines a specific color scale for the plot.
        # Choose a predefined color scheme (e.g., 'Portland') 
        # we can however use other colorscaleas such as green, grays

    # "colorbar": 
        # Represents the "title" of the color scale.
        # Dictionary defining the "color bar title".


# This formatting must be followed. For more details, refer to the documentation. 
    # We use this kind of notation because it follows Plotly's documentation.


# Now we create a Layout object/variable, it'll be a nested dictionary
layout = dict(geo={'scope':'usa'})

# Notice that we have two main objects:
    # 1. 'data' in dictionary form
    # 2. 'layout'

# These are then passed into graph_objs.Figure()
# Finally, the figure is plotted using iplot

# so we need to use graph_objs.figure
import plotly.graph_objs as go

choromap_1 = go.Figure(data= [data], layout=layout)
# notice, "data" is already in dict form, but we're putting it inside a list

# ----  Plot the figure  ----
# fig1 = iplot(choromap_1, asFigure=True)
# notice that, here "iplot" is from "plotly.offline" not "cufflinks "
    # here, it just displays the plot
    # so "asFigure=True" won't work here
# since it's not a dict or Figure, 
    # we must use "choromap_1" directly from go.Figure() to save as HTML

# ----  Save the figure as an HTML file  ----
# pio.write_html(fig1, 'choromap_1.html', include_plotlyjs='./plotly-2.35.2.min.js')    # ERR

# The reason why df1.iplot(asFigure=True, kind='scattermatrix') works while 
    # iplot(choromap_1, asFigure=True) does not is because they come from different libraries.
        # df1.iplot() is from cufflinks
        # iplot(choromap_1) is from plotly.offline

# display the plot
iplot(choromap_1)

# Save the figure as an HTML file
pio.write_html(choromap_1, 'choromap_1.html', include_plotlyjs='./plotly-2.35.2.min.js')

# --------  Note:  
# If we use plot() instead of iplot(), the plot is shown in an HTML file in a new browser window.  



# ----------------    USA map: Using CSV Dataset    ----------------
# Another example with real data and more options  
# Agricultural exports by state in the USA  
# Example commodities: beef, pork, poultry, dairy, fruits  

import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.read_csv("./data_US_AGRI_Exports")

data = dict(type='choropleth',  
            colorscale='YlOrRd',  # Yellow-Orange-Red scale  
            locations=df1['code'],  # State abbreviations  
            locationmode='USA-states',  
            z=df1['total exports'],  # Color intensities based on total exports  
            text=df1['text'],  # Additional info for each state  
            colorbar={'title': 'Millions USD'},  # Title for color scale  
            marker=dict(line=dict(color='rgb(255,255,255)', width=2))  # White state borders  
        )

# Explanation of parameters:  
#   - 'colorscale': Using 'YlOrRd' (Yellow-Orange-Red)  
#   - 'locations': State abbreviations stored in df1['code']  
#   - 'locationmode': 'USA-states' specifies a state-level map  
#   - 'z': Total exports determine color intensities  
#   - 'text': Labels from df1['text'], but often needs customization  
#   - 'colorbar': Title represents exports in millions of USD  
#   - 'marker': Defines state borders in white with a width of 2  

# we need to modify:    layout = dict(geo={'scope':'usa'})
layout = dict(  
    title="2011 USA Agricultural Exports",  
    geo=dict(  
        scope='usa',  
        showlakes=True,  
        lakecolor='rgb(85, 173, 240)'  # Blue lakes  
    )  
)

# Create the map  
import plotly.graph_objs as go
choromap_2 = go.Figure(data=[data], layout=layout)

# Save the figure as an HTML file  
pio.write_html(choromap_2, 'choromap_2.html', include_plotlyjs='./plotly-2.35.2.min.js')

# Notice as we hover over the "states", we can see all the "text".  
# We can also see that the "lakes" are "blue".  
# Observe the color scale and the title.  

# Also, notice the spacing (white lines) between the statesâ€”this is due to the "marker" setting:  
    # marker=dict(line=dict(color='rgb(255,255,255)', width=2))  
    # We can increase the width if needed.  

# Although the syntax and order might be confusing at first, Plotly works this way.  
    # That's why we'll use this notebook as a reference 
    # and also refer to the documentation for Plotly's choropleth maps.  
# Most of the time, we'll just copy and paste the code and fill in the gaps for our particular dataset.  
# However, these techniques are valuable because they help create clear and visually appealing geographical plots.
