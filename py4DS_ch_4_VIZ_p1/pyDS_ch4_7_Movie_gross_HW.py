""" 
    In this section we learned:

        1.	Category data type in Python
                * seperate 'numerical' data from 'categorical' data
                * e.g. "Years" are categorical data (even though they are numbers)
                * we converted "Years" numeric to categorical
            
        2.	JointPlots
                * Hex type of jointplot, kind='hex', 'Hexagonal' clustered presentation

        3.	Histograms

        4.	Stacked Histograms
                * used python to plot using 'pyplot'

        5.	KDE Plot
                * we mostly used

        6.	Using the Subplots() function
                * layout/figure containing multiple plots

        7.	Violinplots
                * comparison between 'Violinplots' & 'Boxplot'

        8.	Creating a Facet Grid
                * observe evolution of a dataset in a plot

        9.	Coordinates and Diagonals
                * setting facet-grids axix & draw diagonal for comparison

        10.	Building Dashboards
                * using 'subplots' with 'seaborn'
                * overlaying plots on top of other

        11.	Styling Tips
                * background, seaborn styles

        12.	Finishing Touches
                * Thematic changes, title, axis-lables, font-sizes, tick-font-size, legend size

""" 
    The movie reviews website was very happy with your deliverable for the previous assignment (visualizations in this section, e.g. dashboard).
    
    Now they have a new request for you:
        The previous consultant had created a chart for them which is illustrated on the given image. 
        However the 'Python code' used to create the diagram has since been lost and cannot be recovered (LOL). 

    1. Your task is to come up with the code that will  re-create the same chart making it look as close as possible to the original.

    2. Also A new dataset has been supplied.



    --------    Dataset    --------
    Dataset: Following parameters are important for analysis.
        There are 608 data/entries

        Day of the week: the day movie was launched.
        Director
        Genre: action, comedy etc.
        Movie Title
        Relese date
        Studio

        Gross in milin dollers
        Adjusted gross: Because some Movies relesed in the previous years
                        Adjusted for the inflations
        Budget in milin dollers

        IMDB rating
        movieLens rating

        Oveseas gross: Earnings outside the US; 
        overseas %: for comparison with total gross
        Profit: million dollers (from budget and the gross)
        Profit %
        Runtime: length of the movie
        US gross & US gross %



    --------    Previous plot    --------
    It's a Boxplot
    X-axis: Genre
    Y-axis: Gross % in US (last column in our dtaset)
        action avg 40% gross
        comedy avg 50%
    
    Studios as 'hue/group' and colored legends
        represented dots by the columns



    --------    Hints/Clues    --------
    Hint 1: 
        Filter the dataset using '6 studios' from the given plot
            eg. 'TriStar' is not in the plot
            Bueno Vista Studios
            Use: Sony, Universal, WB, Paramount Pictures, Fox

        Filter the 'Genre' also, use 5-generes present in the plot
            eg. 'Biography' is not in the plot
            Use: action, comedy, adventure, animation, drama
                

    Hint 2: 
        Use the 'fill_in_blank' file
            Import library/packages
            Load data
            Explore the data
            Filter the data-set
            Make the plot

    # 'Year' is a numerical data, but we should treat it as 'category'. Why?
    # lets do more exploration to understand the reason - 

# Get some information
movies.info()

# Notice we have 6 columns
    # 2 of those are 'objects' but not 'category' yet
    # 4 of those are int type

    # 'CriticRating', 'AudienceRating', 'BudgetMillions' are meaningful in int-type
        # these can have mean, variance, max, min and other statistical-data

    # But "Years" cannot be treated as 'int-type'. There is no mean, variance for "Years"
        # We don't really treat "Years" as numerical data. "Years" is a 'Ctegorical data'
        # We have to convert "Years" from NUMERICAL data to 'CTEGORICAL data'
        # Notice right now we have mean, variance, max, min, 25%(1st quartel), 50%(median), 75%(3rd quartel)  for "Year". Which is absurd.


# Statistical info
movies.describe()
# mean, variance, max, min, 25%(1st quartel), 50%(median), 75%(3rd quartel) make sense for 
    # 'CriticRating', 'AudienceRating', 'BudgetMillions'
    # those statistical info have no meaning foor "Year"
        # So we treat "Year" as categorical data
        # "Years" are presented as numbers, but there could be moonths (Jan, Feb, Mar)
        # after transformatioon to categorical variable we can still do some basic arithmatic operation like 'Dofference', 'max', 'min'
