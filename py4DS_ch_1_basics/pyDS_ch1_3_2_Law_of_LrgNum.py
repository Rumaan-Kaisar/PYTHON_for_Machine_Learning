# -------------    Law of Large numbers (LLN)    -------------
# Simple but Powerful concept:
# Consider the "coin toss example"
    # we know we have 50/50 chance of getting HEAD or TAIL.
        # But if we toss the coin for a very fiew time say 10 times, it wont be 50-50
            # toss 10 times: HEAD : TAIL    =  70% : 30%
            # toss 100 times: HEAD : TAIL    =  60% : 40%
            # toss 1000 times: HEAD : TAIL    =  55% : 45%
            # toss 10000 times: HEAD : TAIL    =  51% : 49%


# Law of Large numbers (LLN):
    # Say we have a sample, the 'average of the sample' converges to EXPECTED VALUE of that sample 
        # if the 'number of observations' tends to infinity.



# -----------    Normal distribution of random numbers    -----------
# We got a bell-shaped Normal-Distribution curve
# It says: 
    # There is 34.1% probability that the random number lies between (0, 1)
    # There is 34.1% probability that the random number lies between (-1, 0)
    # There is total 68.2% probability that the random number lies between (-1, 1)
