# ------------    SF Salaries Overview    ------------

""" 
On the Salary Exercise, one of the questions asks 
    how many people have the word "chief" in their title. 
    
    The solution is actually slightly off, 
    We didn't take into account people that had 
        "punctuation" in their title right next to the word "chief", 
        for example : Chief, Justice.
