    "The **bias-variance tradeoff** is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the tension between a modelâ€™s ability to **fit the training data well** (low bias) and its ability to **generalize to new, unseen data** (low variance). It helps explain why models underfit or overfit and guides model selection and regularization.\n",
