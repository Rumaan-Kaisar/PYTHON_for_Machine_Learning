    "After training a model, it is essential to measure how well it performs on data it has never seen. Performance metrics quantify a model’s success and guide improvements. In classification, these metrics derive from comparing predicted labels to ground-truth labels on held-out (test or validation) data.\n",

    "    * either make a correct prediction or \n",
    "    * an incorrect prediction  \n",
    "\n",
    "-   Every classification metric is built on this basic idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In multi-class situations** (e.g. predicting A, B, C, or D):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A prediction is **correct** if the predicted class matches the actual class.\n",
    "   * It’s **incorrect** if it predicts the wrong class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **To simplify the explanation of classification metrics**, it's easier to start with **binary classification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Only **two possible classes** (e.g., Class 0 and Class 1).\n",
    "   * This makes it clearer to understand concepts like\n",
    "     - true positives, \n",
    "     - false positives, \n",
    "     - true negatives, and \n",
    "     - false negatives.\n",
    "   * The same ideas behind these metrics can later be **extended to multi-class problems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Consider following Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example:**\n",
    "   We want to predict whether a given image shows a dog or a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approach:**\n",
    "   This can be done using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which is a type of neural network designed for image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Supervised Learning:**\n",
    "   This is a **supervised learning problem** because we \"train or fit\" the model using images that already have known labels (either \"dog\" or \"cat\").\n",
    "   - This means we have images that have already been labeled as 'dog' or 'cat,' \n",
    "   - so we know the correct answer for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Phase:**\n",
    "   In this phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The model is shown many labeled images.\n",
    "   * It learns to find patterns that help it classify new images correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Testing Phase:**\n",
    "   After training:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The model is tested on new, unseen images (test data).\n",
    "   * It makes predictions on whether each image is a dog or a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The model's **predictions** are compared with the **true labels** (called **ground truth**) for these test images.\n",
    "     - So first get model's predictions for the test data (X)\n",
    "     - then compare them to the true labels (i.e. correct answers Y)\n",
    "   * This helps measure how well the model performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Evaluation Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model on the training data, we evaluate its performance using the **test dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each test image is called **X_test** (the feature).\n",
    "* So the **image** itself is a feature, and this is from the **test set**\n",
    "* The corresponding correct label for that image is called **Y\\_test** (the ground truth).\n",
    "* We pass **X\\_test** to the model to get its prediction and then compare it to **Y\\_test** to see if the prediction is correct.\n",
    "* Say we have an image of a dog. We pass this image (as input features) into the already trained model, and the model makes a prediction.\n",
    "  - **Correct prediction:** If the model \"predicts\" dog, and the \"correct label\" is also dog, the prediction is correct.  \n",
    "    i.e. $\\text{dog (prediction)} = \\text{dog (correct label)}$\n",
    "  - **Incorrect prediction:** If it predicts cat instead, comparison with the correct label would be incorrect.  \n",
    "    i.e. $\\text{cat (prediction)} \\neq \\text{dog (correct label)}$  \n",
    "So in our casse, there are always two outcomes: **_correct_** or **_incorrect_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This process repeats for every image in **X\\_test**.\n",
    "* At the end, we count how many predictions were correct and how many were incorrect.\n",
    "* **Important point:** In real-world problems, not all correct or incorrect predictions have the same importance.\n",
    "* A single metric (like accuracy) often isn’t enough to describe model performance.\n",
    "* To properly evaluate a model, we look at **four key metrics** — let’s revisit those and see how they’re calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🎈**Accuracy and Confusion Matrix:**\n",

    "* We can organize predicted and actual values using a **confusion matrix** (we’ll explain this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Accuracy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy is one of the most common and easiest classification metrics to understand.\n",
    "* It measures how often the model makes correct predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Formula:**\n",
    "  Accuracy = (Number of correct predictions) ÷ (Total number of predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In simple terms, it tells what **_percentage_** of predictions were correct.\n",

    "\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\\text{Total number of predictions}}\n",

    "  If **X\\_test** has **100 images** and the model correctly predicts **80**, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8 = 80\\%\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy** is most useful when classes are **well balanced**.\n",
    "* **Well balanced** means:\n",
    "  * The dataset has a similar number of images for each class.\n",
    "  * For example: about the same number of **cat** and **dog** images.\n",
    "  * The labels are evenly represented in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### **Accuracy** isn't reliable when classes are **imbalanced.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What's an imbalanced class situation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * One class has many more examples than the other.\n",
    "  * Example: **99 dog images** and **1 cat image** in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Thought experiment:**\n",
    "  * If we use a test set of 99 dogs and 1 cat images and\n",
    "  * If a model always predicts **dog**, \n",
    "  * so it would it be correct **99 times out of 100** on this particular test set\n",
    "  * This gives **99% accuracy**, even though the model completely ignores the **cat class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key point:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In imbalanced situations, accuracy can be misleading.\n",
    "  * It looks high but doesn’t reflect real performance on the minority class.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Works well if classes are balanced.\n",
    "  * Problematic if one class dominates.\n",

    "#### **2. Key Clarifications & Corrections:**  \n",
    "- **Misconception**: \"MAE is always better because it’s simpler.\"  \n",
    "  - **Reality**: MAE is robust to outliers but may hide significant prediction flaws. MSE/RMSE are preferred when large errors are costly (e.g., medical dosing).  \n",
    "- **Units Matter**:  \n",
    "  - The text correctly notes that MSE’s squared units are unintuitive, but RMSE fixes this.  \n",
    "- **Error Metric Selection**:  \n",
    "  - Not explicitly stated: **Huber Loss** (a hybrid of MAE/MSE) is another option for balancing outlier sensitivity and interpretability.  \n",

    "#### **3. Pedagogical Approach:**  \n",
    "- **Simplification**: Uses house price prediction as an intuitive example.  \n",
    "- **Real-World Analogy**: Contrasts RMSE applicability for housing (good) vs. candy bars (bad).  \n",
    "- **Warning Against Blind Metrics**: Emphasizes that error values must be compared to the dataset’s scale.  \n",

    "#### **4. Final Summary:**  \n",
    "This lecture explains **regression evaluation metrics**:  \n",
    "1. **MAE**: Simple but ignores outlier severity.  \n",
    "2. **MSE**: Punishes large errors but hard to interpret.  \n",
    "3. **RMSE**: Best of both worlds (sensitive to outliers + interpretable units).  \n",
    "4. **Context is King**: No metric is universally \"good\"—always compare to domain-specific benchmarks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Topic**: Likely model tuning (e.g., hyperparameter optimization) or advanced regression techniques.  \n",
