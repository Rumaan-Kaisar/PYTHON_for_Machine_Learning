# ------------    pandas    ------------
# pandas is a library for datascience tools
    # it is used for data analysis and manipulation
    # it provides data structures like "DataFrame" and "Series" for handling and analyzing structured data.

# we can call it: python version of excel or python vesrsion of R

# Pandas is an open source library built on top of "NumPy" 
    # i.e. you need to learn numpy first

    # It allows for :
            # fast analysis 
            # data cleaning  
            # preparation

    # It excels in performance and productivity
    # It also has built-in data-visualization features
    # It can work with data from a wide variety of sources.

# install: 
    # open cmd          >>  pip install pandas
    # or open conda     >>  conda install pandas


# --------   Objectives   --------

    # Missing Data 
    # GroupBy
    # Mergingjoining^nd Concatenating 
    # Operations
    # Data Input and Output: csv, excel files, SQL and more



# --------    series    --------
# it's the one of the "Pandas Data-type"
    # we'll use series a lot to build Data-Frames

# A "series" is very similar to "numpy-array"
    # it's actually built on top of "numpy-array object"

# The difference bewteen "pandas-series" and "numpy-array" is:
    # series can access lebels, i.e. it can "indexed by labels"
