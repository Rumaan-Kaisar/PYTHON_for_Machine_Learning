# Since we're now fimiliar with DataFrames, how data is stored in that (and data-Analysis libraries), 
# it's time to learn how can we visualize it

# ----  Intro to Matplotlib  ----
# Matplotlib is Python's most popular plotting library.
# It allows full control over every part of a figure.
# It was created to resemble MatLab's graphical plotting.
# It works with Pandas and Numpy arrays 
# 'Seaborn' (another plotting library) is built on top of 'Matplotlib'
    # We need to understand Matplotlib first to learn Seaborn.
