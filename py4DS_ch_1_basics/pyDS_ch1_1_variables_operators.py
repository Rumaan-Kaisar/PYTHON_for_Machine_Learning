# Anaconda:
    # it is a distribution of Python 
    # Its an â€œall-in-one" install that is extremely popular in data science and machine learning!
    # This means it includes not only Python, but many libraries that we use in Data-Science, 
    # It has its own virtual environment system. 

# Jupyter:
    # It is the most popular IDE in data science for exploring and analyzing data!
    # Jupyter is a "development environment" where we can 
            # write code, 
            # display images, and 
            # write down markdown notes.



# ----------------    Anaconda, jupyter Installation    ----------------
    # install anaconda for Python 3.XXX, Graphical installer
        # Note: Do Not check "Add anaconda to my PATH env" & "Register anaconda as ... Python 3.XX"
        # these will make problems if you had pre installed Python envs
    # Go to "Anaconda Navigator" -> "Jupyter Notebook"
            # or
    # open command line/terminal in your 'current folder' [win-path: type 'cmd'] 
    # or use 'cd' in cmd to change the directory
    # cmd >> jupyter notebook

    # ------------    Anaconda virtual environment    ------------
    # Virtual Environments allow you to set up virtual installations of Python and libraries on your computer. 
    # You can have "multiple versions" of Python or libraries and easily activate or deactivate these environments 
    # Let's see some examples of why you may want to do this
        # Sometimes you'll want to program in different versions of a library. For example:
            # You develop a program with SciKit-Learn 0.17 then SciKit-Learn 0.18 is released
            # You want to explore 0.18 but don't want your old code to break
        # Sometimes you'll to make sure your library installations are in the correct location For example:
            # You want multiple versions of Python on your computer
            # You want one environment with Py 2.7 and another with Py 3.5
        # There is the "virtualenv" library for normal Python distributions
            # Anaconda has a built-in virtual environment manager that makes the whole process really easy
            # http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html

    # Commands:
        # conda create --name env_name package_name
            # EG: conda create --name snowflakes biopython
            # EG: conda create --name fluffy numpy
            # if python version isn't specified, the base version will be used
        # activate fluffy
            # there will be different python packages in yor "venev" than the "base env"
            # to install package inside the active environment: 
                # conda install pandas
        # deactivate                

        # specific python version:
            # conda create --name env_name python=3.5 package_name
            # EG: conda create --name mypy3 python=3.5 numpy
            # EG: following creates an environment with entire anaconda ditribution
                # conda create --name mypy3 python=3.5 ANACONDA

        # CHECKS existed venvs:
            # conda info --envs
        
        # changing, cloning & removing environments are straight forward, just Google them


# ----------------    Run jupyter in VS-code    ----------------
# But we're gonna use VS-code to run "Jupyter Notebook - ipynb" files
    # install ipykernel package (vs-code): Running cells with 'Python 3.10.3 64-bit' requires ipykernel package.
    # Allow VS-code in windows sequrity (if pop-up appears)


# Use shortcut keys:
    # Shift + Enter : to run a code and open a 'New cell'
    # ctrl + enter: works for VS-code (Jupyter NB), It only runs a 'cell'
    # ALt + Enter: same as 'Shift + Enter',  to run a code and open a 'New cell'
    # use 'Help -> Keyboard Shortcuts'

    # A Jypyter NB file can be exported as 'py' file

    # Kernel Restart:
        # If you run a infinite loop or somthing that crashing the program
        # use 'Restart' or 'Kernel -> Restart'

    # Markdown Cells:
        # other than 'code-cells' Jypyter has 'markdown cells'



# ----------------    MARKDOWN Basics (ChatGPT)    ----------------
""" 
    These are some of the basic syntaxes for 'formatting text' in Jupyter Markdown. 
    You can combine these elements to create more complex documents.
    


    1. Headings: 
        Use the pound symbol (#) followed by a space to create headings. 
        The number of pound symbols indicates the level of the heading (from 1 to 6, with 1 being the highest level).
            Use #, ##, ###, ####, #####, ###### for For 6-level of 'Headings'
        
        Example:
            # Heading 1
            ## Heading 2
            ### Heading 3



    2. Bold Text:
        Surround the text with double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__)
        "No space"

        Example:
            **Bold Text**
            __Bold Text__



    3. Italic Text:
        Surround the text with single asterisks (*) or single underscores (_)
        "No space"

        Example:
            *Italic Text*
            _Italic Text_



    4. Bulleted Lists:
        Use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-) "followed by a space"

        Example:
            - Item 1
            - Item 2
                * Sub-item 1
                * Sub-item 2



    5. Numbered Lists:
        Use numbers followed by a period (.) and "a space" to create numbered lists.

        Example:
            1. First item
            2. Second item



    6. Links:
        Enclose the 'text' you want to display in square brackets [] and 
        the 'URL' in parentheses ().

        Example:
            [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com)



    7. Images:
        Similar to links, but with an exclamation mark (!) before the square brackets.
        Also you can use HTML tag <img src>

        Example:
            ![Alt text](path/to/image.png)
            or
            <img src='.././path'>



    8. Horizontal Rule:
        Use three or more hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves to create a horizontal rule.

        Example:
            ---


    9. Center aligned text
        To center-align text in a Markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook: 
            Use HTML formatting tags. Specifically, you can use the <div> tag with the style attribute set to text-align: center;
        
        Example: 
            <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
                This text will be centered.
            </div>
