# ------------    Matrix Plots    ------------
# Matrix plots display data as color-encoded matrices and can highlight clusters within the data.
# We'll learn how to create matrix plots (primarily heatmaps) in Seaborn.
# Let's explore Seaborn's heatmap and clustermap:

# import libraries
import seaborn as sns
# shows figures in ipynb
%matplotlib inline

# To remove 'warnings' use 'filterwarnings'
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# lets load a builtin dataset of seaborn. we import 2 datasets: 'tips' and 'flights'
    # tips: a dataset of restaurant patrons' tipping behavior
    # flights: shows the number of passengers for each month of given years
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips.head()

flights = sns.load_dataset('flights')
flights.head()


# --------    heatmap    --------
# heatmap : primary way of showing the matrix plots
# in order to work with heatmap, our data need to be in "matrix form"
# "index name" and "column name" should match up so that 
#   the "cell value" indicates something relavant to both of those index name and column name
