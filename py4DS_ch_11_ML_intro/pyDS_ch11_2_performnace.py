The most common question I get from students is: Hey, does this value of RMSE good?
And as always, context is everything.

Let's imagine you were doing some kind of ML model and got a root mean squared error  (RMSE) of ten dollars, and you're asking, "Is this a good enough RMSE?"

Well, it really depends on the context of the situation.

It means a RMSE of ten-dollar quarter would be fantastic if you're predicting the price of a house, since ten dollars is very small compared to the average price of a house.

But if your machine learning model was supposed to predict the price of a chocolate bar based on its characteristics, and your RMSE was ten dollars. Actually, that's really bad. 



What we need to do is compare your "error metric" for the regression task with the average label value.
i.e. the mean value in your dataset to try to get an intuition about its overall performance.

And as always, domain knowledge also plays a really important role here.
So, machine learning again isn't done in a vacuum; it's usually done with a collaborative process.
So, if you're predicting house prices and want to get a sense of whether your routine error was good or not, 
it's probably a good idea to start talking to someone with experience such as- a real estate agent.



Sure — here’s a clean, simplified, middle-ground version without losing context:

---

* A common student question: **Is this RMSE value good?**
* The answer: **It depends on the context.**
* Example:

  * An **RMSE of \$10** is excellent if predicting **house prices**.
  * The same **\$10 RMSE** is terrible if predicting the **price of a chocolate bar**.
* To judge RMSE, compare it to the **average label value** in your dataset.
* This gives a sense of whether the error is small or large relative to typical values.
* Also, always involve **domain experts**.

  * For house prices → talk to a **real estate agent**.
  * For medical predictions → consult **doctors**.
* Key idea: **ML performance metrics only make sense within their problem’s context**.
