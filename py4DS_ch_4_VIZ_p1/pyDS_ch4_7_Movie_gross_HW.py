""" 
    In this section we learned:

        1.	Category data type in Python
                * seperate 'numerical' data from 'categorical' data
                * e.g. "Years" are categorical data (even though they are numbers)
                * we converted "Years" numeric to categorical
            
        2.	JointPlots
                * Hex type of jointplot, kind='hex', 'Hexagonal' clustered presentation

        3.	Histograms

        4.	Stacked Histograms
                * used python to plot using 'pyplot'

        5.	KDE Plot
                * we mostly used

        6.	Using the Subplots() function
                * layout/figure containing multiple plots

        7.	Violinplots
                * comparison between 'Violinplots' & 'Boxplot'

        8.	Creating a Facet Grid
                * observe evolution of a dataset in a plot

        9.	Coordinates and Diagonals
                * setting facet-grids axix & draw diagonal for comparison

        10.	Building Dashboards
                * using 'subplots' with 'seaborn'
                * overlaying plots on top of other

        11.	Styling Tips
                * background, seaborn styles

        12.	Finishing Touches
                * Thematic changes, title, axis-lables, font-sizes, tick-font-size, legend size

    The movie reviews website was very happy with your deliverable for the previous assignment (visualizations in this section, e.g. dashboard).
    
    Now they have a new request for you:
        The previous consultant had created a chart for them which is illustrated on the given image. 
        However the 'Python code' used to create the diagram has since been lost and cannot be recovered (LOL). 

    1. Your task is to come up with the code that will  re-create the same chart making it look as close as possible to the original.

    2. Also A new dataset has been supplied.



    --------    Dataset    --------
    Dataset: Following parameters are important for analysis.
        There are 608 data/entries

        Day of the week: the day movie was launched.
        Director
        Genre: action, comedy etc.
        Movie Title
        Relese date
        Studio

        Gross in milin dollers
        Adjusted gross: Because some Movies relesed in the previous years
                        Adjusted for the inflations
        Budget in milin dollers

        IMDB rating
        movieLens rating

        Oveseas gross: Earnings outside the US; 
        overseas %: for comparison with total gross
        Profit: million dollers (from budget and the gross)
