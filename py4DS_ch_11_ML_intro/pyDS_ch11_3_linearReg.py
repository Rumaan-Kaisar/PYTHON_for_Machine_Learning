Hello everyone and welcome to an introduction to linear regression and this lecture we're going to get

a light theoretical background history behind the idea of linear regression before we actually tackle

the concept with Python and the sikat learn library.

If you want a deeper mathematical understanding of linear regression.

You can go ahead and check out chapters 2 and 3 of an introduction to statistical learning.

Let's discuss the history behind literary aggression.

This entire idea all started back in the 1800s a man named Francis gult in Colten was studying the relationship

between parents and their children and in particular he investigated the relationship between the heights

of fathers and the heights of their sons.

What he discovered was that a man's son tended to be roughly as tall as his father.

However Galton's breakthrough was at the son's high tended to be closer to the overall average height

of all people.

Let's go ahead and take an example of this.

Shaquille O'Neal was a famous NBA player is very tall.

He's 7 foot 1 inch or 2.2 meters tall.

If Shaq as he's known has a son chances are he'll be pretty tall too.

However Czech is such an anomaly in height that there is also a very good chance that his son is not

going to be as tall as Shaq.

And it turns out this is the case.

Shaquille O'Neal son is pretty tall.

He's 6 foot seven inches but he's not nearly as tall as his dad who was 7 foot 1 Gault him calls this

phenomenon regression as in a fathers sons Height's tends to regress or drift towards the mean or average

height of everyone else.

Let's go ahead and begin to plot out the sort of example let's cut to the regression with only two data

points which is the simplest possible example.

Here we have two data points.

Sequels to and white was for as one data point and the X sequel's 5 and y equals 10 is another data

point.

These two little black dots all we're trying to do when we calculate our regression line is draw a line

that's as close to every dot as possible for classic linear regression or the least squares method.

You only measure the closeness in the up and down their action.

Here we have a perfectly fitted line because we only had two points.

Now wouldn't it be great if we could apply this same concept to grasp with more than just two data points

.

By doing this we could take multiple men and their sons heights and do things like tell Amanda how tall

we expect the son to be before he even has a son.

And this is the idea behind supervised learning.

We're going to have a bunch of labeled data points create a model.

In this case in theory aggression and try to take unlabeled data such as a father's high and spit back

out labeled data our prediction of the sun's height.

Our goal if linear regression is to minimize the vertical distance between all the data points in our

line.

So in determining the best line we are attempting to minimize the distance between all the points and

distance to our line.

There are lots of actually different ways to minimize this.

The sum of squares error some of absolute errors etc..

But all of these methods have a general goal of minimizing the distance between your line and the rest

of the data points.

For example one of the most popular methods that we just described is the least squares method.

Here we have a couple of blue data points along an x and y axes and we want to fit a linear regression

line.

And the question is how do we decide which line is the best fitting one we can go ahead and use the

least squares method which we discussed earlier.

This method is fitted by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals the residuals for an observation

is the difference between the observation the y value and the fitted line.

In this image the residuals are marked by the red line.

The difference between the true data point in blue and your fitted model line.

The black Bagenal line.

Right in the next lecture.

We're going to use sikat learned in Python to create a linear regression model.

Then you'll have your own portfolio project exercise and afterwards we'll go over the solutions to that

project.

Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture.

## Introduction to Linear Regression

This introduction provides a light theoretical background and historical context for the idea of **linear regression** before exploring its implementation using Python and the scikit-learn library. For readers interested in a deeper mathematical treatment, Chapters 2 and 3 of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* offer a comprehensive explanation.

## Historical Background

The concept of regression dates back to the 1800s, when **Francis Galton** studied the relationship between parents and their children — specifically, the relationship between fathers' heights and their sons' heights. Galton observed that while tall fathers tended to have tall sons, those sons' heights tended to be closer to the average height of the general population, rather than exactly matching their fathers' stature.

For example, NBA player **Shaquille O'Neal**, who is 7 feet 1 inch (2.2 meters) tall, has a son who is also tall at 6 feet 7 inches, but not nearly as tall as his father. Galton termed this phenomenon **"regression"** — describing how an extreme characteristic in one generation tends to move closer to the mean in subsequent generations.

## Concept of Linear Regression

The basic idea behind linear regression is to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line to observed data points. The goal is to find a line that is as close as possible to all the data points, minimizing the differences between the actual data values and the predicted values made by the line.

A simple example involves only two data points: one at (x = 2, y = 4) and another at (x = 5, y = 10). With just these two points, a perfect line can be drawn through both. However, the real value of regression lies in applying this technique to larger datasets, where predictions can be made for new, unlabeled data based on learned patterns.

## The Role in Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, a model is built from labeled data. In the context of regression, the model learns the relationship between the input features (such as a father's height) and the target variable (the son's height). Once trained, the model can then predict outcomes for new data points. The objective is to minimize the **vertical distance (errors or residuals)** between the predicted values (on the regression line) and the actual data points.

## Minimizing Error: Least Squares Method

Various methods exist for measuring and minimizing these differences, including the **sum of squared errors** and **sum of absolute errors**. One of the most widely used techniques is the **least squares method**, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals — the differences between actual observed values and the values predicted by the regression line.

In a regression plot, data points are displayed along the x and y axes. The regression line is drawn through the data, and the residuals are the vertical distances from each data point to the line. These residuals are squared and summed, and the line that produces the smallest total is selected as the best fit.
