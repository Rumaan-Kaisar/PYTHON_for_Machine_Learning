    "### üìâ What Is a *Moving Average*?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **moving average (MA)** is a **statistical technique** used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and <br> highlight longer-term trends in a dataset‚Äîcommonly applied to **time series data** like stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßÆ How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A moving average calculates the **average value** of a variable (e.g., stock closing price) over a **sliding window** of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- A **5-day moving average** of stock prices takes the average of the **last 5 days**, then shifts forward one day and does it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** | Equal weighting of past values over the selected window.               |\n",
    "| **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** | Gives **more weight** to recent data; reacts more quickly to changes. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Why It‚Äôs Useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend Detection**: Helps identify bullish (upward) or bearish (downward) trends.\n",
    "- **Noise Reduction**: Removes daily volatility and makes patterns clearer.\n",
    "- **Signals**: Often used in strategies like the ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù (short MA crossing above long MA).\n",

    "### üß† Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If daily prices are: `[100, 102, 101, 105, 110]`,  \n",
    "The **3-day moving average** would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Day 3: (100 + 102 + 101)/3 = 101.0  \n",
    "Day 4: (102 + 101 + 105)/3 = 102.67  \n",
    "Day 5: (101 + 105 + 110)/3 = 105.33\n",

    "  - **Stabilize training**, especially in deep learning.\n",
    "  - Keep a smoother version of the model for **evaluation** or **inference**.\n",
    "- Used in frameworks like TensorFlow: `tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage`\n",

    "#### 2. **Learning Rate Schedulers**\n",
    "- In adaptive optimizers (like Adam or RMSProp), EMA is used to track:\n",
    "  - **Gradient means** and **squared gradients** over time (to adapt learning rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**\n",
    "- Moving average is used to **track reward trends**:\n",
    "  - To observe agent performance over time.\n",
    "  - For **baseline estimation** in policy gradients to reduce variance.\n",

    "#### 4. **Smoothing Metrics**\n",
