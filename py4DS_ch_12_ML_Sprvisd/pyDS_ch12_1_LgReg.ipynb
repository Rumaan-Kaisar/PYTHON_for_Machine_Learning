    "## Logistic Regression: Classification Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Purpose of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression is a method used in **classification problems** within machine learning and statistics.\n",
    "* It is designed to predict **discrete categories**, not continuous values.\n",
    "* Although the name includes “regression,” its primary use is **classification**, especially **binary classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What Is a Classification Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification involves assigning a new observation to one of several predefined categories based on training data.\n",
    "* Common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Spam vs. non-spam (ham) email detection\n",
    "  * Loan default vs. non-default prediction\n",
    "  * Disease diagnosis (disease present vs. absent)\n",
    "* These examples represent **binary classification**, where there are only two possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why Linear Regression Is Not Suitable for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "* In binary classification, class labels are typically represented as **0 and 1**.\n",
    "* Linear regression predicts continuous values and can output values less than 0 or greater than 1.\n",
    "* When interpreting outputs as probabilities, such values are invalid.\n",
    "* Therefore, linear regression produces a poor fit for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Logistic Regression and the Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression solves this problem by applying the **sigmoid (logistic) function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sigmoid function maps any real-valued input to a range strictly between **0 and 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its mathematical form is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  [\n",
    "  \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "\n",
    "* No matter how large or small the input value ( z ) is, the output always lies between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This property makes the sigmoid function ideal for modeling probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. From Linear Model to Logistic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* A standard linear model has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "  [\n",
    "  z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression applies the sigmoid function to this linear combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This transformation ensures the final output is a valid probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a result, logistic regression predicts the **probability of belonging to class 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Decision Boundary and Classification Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "* A cutoff (threshold) value is chosen, commonly **0.5**.\n",
    "* Classification rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If predicted probability < 0.5 → assign **class 0**\n",
    "  * If predicted probability ≥ 0.5 → assign **class 1**\n",
    "* This converts probabilistic output into discrete class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Model Evaluation Using a Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "* After training a logistic regression model, its performance is evaluated using test data.\n",
    "* A **confusion matrix** summarizes prediction results when true labels are known.\n",
    "* It is commonly used for binary classification problems, such as disease detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Confusion Matrix Components\n",
    "\n",
    "For a binary classification problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positive (TP)**\n",
    "  Predicted positive and actually positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Negative (TN)**\n",
    "  Predicted negative and actually negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False Positive (FP)**\n",
    "  Predicted positive but actually negative.\n",
    "  Also called **Type I error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False Negative (FN)**\n",
    "  Predicted negative but actually positive.\n",
    "  Also called **Type II error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy**\n",
    "  Measures how often the model is correct overall.\n",
    "  [\n",
    "  \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{\\text{Total predictions}}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Misclassification Rate (Error Rate)**\n",
    "  Measures how often the model is wrong.\n",
    "  [\n",
    "  \\text{Error Rate} = \\frac{FP + FN}{\\text{Total predictions}}\n",

    "* **Type I Error (False Positive)**\n",
    "  Predicting a condition exists when it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type II Error (False Negative)**\n",
    "  Predicting a condition does not exist when it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These terms are widely used in statistics, medicine, and hypothesis testing.\n",

    "### 11. Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression is commonly applied to real-world datasets.\n",
    "* Typical tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Predicting survival outcomes using passenger features\n",
    "  * Predicting user behavior, such as whether an advertisement is clicked\n",
    "* These applications demonstrate how logistic regression connects theory to practice.\n",
