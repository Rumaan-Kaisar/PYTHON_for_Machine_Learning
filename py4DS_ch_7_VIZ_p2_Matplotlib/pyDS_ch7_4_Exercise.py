# ------------    matplotlib exercise    ------------
# Following are reletively simple plots
# Don't focus too much on the Matplotlib syntax; we'll be using Seaborn in the next chapter.
# Since Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib, it's important to understand Matplotlib first.

# note: all the commands for plotting a figure should all go in the same cell. separating them out into multiple cells may cause nothing to show up

# use following data
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(0, 100)   # array of [0, 1, ..., 99]
y = 2*x
z = x**2
