    "  * **Bias** — error from wrong assumptions in the model (underfitting).\n",
    "  * **Variance** — error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data (overfitting).\n",
    "* The goal is to pick a model that **fits real patterns** (low bias) but **does not memorize noise** (low variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 — Intuition (training vs test error)\n",
    "\n",
    "* As model complexity increases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Training error** generally **decreases** (model fits training data better).\n",
    "  * **Test error** usually **decreases at first** (better fit), then **increases** once the model starts overfitting.\n",
    "* The optimal point is the **sweet spot** where test error is minimal — the best bias/variance balance.\n",

    "## 3 — Underfitting vs Overfitting\n",

    "* **Underfitting (high bias, low variance)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Model too simple to capture true relationships (e.g., fitting a straight line to clearly curved data).\n",
    "  * High error on both training and test sets.\n",
    "* **Overfitting (low bias, high variance)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Model too complex, fits noise and outliers.\n",
    "  * Very low training error but high test error.\n",
    "* **Good fit**: moderate complexity, low test error.\n",

    "* True relationship = smooth curve (black line).\n",

    "  * **Simple model** (linear): misses curvature → underfit.\n",
    "  * **Moderate complexity** (quadratic): can match the true curve → often best.\n",
    "  * **Very complex** (high-degree spline): wiggles through every point → overfits, worse on new data.\n",

    "## 5 — Classification analogy (dartboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each model training is one “shot” at a dartboard target:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Low bias, low variance** → shots clustered tightly on bullseye (ideal).\n",
