On the Salary Exercise, one of the questions asks how many people have the word "chief" in their title. My solution is actually slightly off, I didn't take into account people that had punctuation in their title right next to the word chief, for example : Chief, Justice. 

If you want to see a full discussion, search the qa forums for 'chief' , there are a lot of thread where students have posted alternative solutions that work correctly (there are a lot of ways to solve this one)
