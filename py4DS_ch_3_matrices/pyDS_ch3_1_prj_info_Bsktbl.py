# We'll analyze the data for those 10 players
    # How they are playing for the past 10 years
    # analyze their performance-patterns in the past ten years
    # How they become top-10 players, how about their previous performance


# about Data-Set:
    # we'll  anlyze following parameters against years 2005 to 2015
    # GP: Total games played by the player
    # MPG: Minutes per game, total minutes played in a season
    # FG%: field goal percentage. (Passed the the ball through the hoop)
        # We'll get this from actual 'Field Goal' and 'Field Goal Attempts'
    # PPG: Points per game. Total points scored in a season

# We'll create matrices:
    # - Salary
    # - Games
    # - MinutesPlayed
    # - FieldGoals
    # - FieldGoalAttempts
    # - Points
