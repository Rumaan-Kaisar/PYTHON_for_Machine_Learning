    "# ----------------    CAPACITY vs COMPLEXITY    ----------------\n",
    "###  I know that in simple machine learning models like linear regression, increasing the polynomial degree increases the model's complexity. But in deep learning, if I add more layers, does that increase the model's complexity or its capacity?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent question - and you’re right to distinguish between **complexity** and **capacity**, because they’re related but not the same thing. Let’s unpack this carefully:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 In Linear / Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you add higher polynomial degrees (e.g., ( x^2, x^3, ... )), you’re **increasing the hypothesis space** - the model can represent more complex nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "* This **increases model capacity**, which is the ability to fit more varied functions.\n",
    "* At the same time, it **increases complexity** (more parameters, higher variance, higher risk of overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in classical ML, capacity and complexity tend to rise together.\n",

    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Model capacity increases:**\n",
    "  The network can now represent more complicated functions and hierarchical features. Each layer can learn a higher level of abstraction - for example, from edges -> shapes -> objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ⚙️ **Model complexity (architectural)** also increases:\n",
    "  There are more parameters, nonlinearities, and interactions, so the *architecture* becomes more complex.\n",

    "* ❗But note: \"complexity\" can mean different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Architectural complexity:** number of layers, parameters, connections.\n",
    "  * **Computational complexity:** how much compute/memory/time training requires.\n",
    "  * **Effective complexity:** how complex the learned function actually is (depends on training, regularization, data, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So adding layers increases **potential complexity** and **capacity**, but **whether the model actually uses that capacity** depends on optimization and regularization (e.g., dropout, weight decay, etc.).\n",
